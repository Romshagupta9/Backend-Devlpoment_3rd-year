persistent--connection bane rhna(single TCP connection)
full duplex--two way communication

real time communication
server driven -- serve ko koi response bhejn aho bar bar

polling

websocket -> communication protocol -> http (bidirectional data communication)

browser -> http
browser <- http (then server break)

connection is persistent (means connection will not break and without client req server can send response), full-duplex communication (two way channel between client and server), over 1 tcp connection

server cannot send any response until and unless req is sent

example: stock exchange:-  http send req and socket send message
(real time communication)

server driven thing is done by websocket

polling if u dont want to use websocket, like after some intervals if we want to send 
the req (we cannot do 30 lakh req work by polling) leetcode use polling bcz one user onluy 
send 3-4 req but in stock exchange price change in milli sec and we have to send soo maky req in 1 min for 1 user so it cant be dont by polling
